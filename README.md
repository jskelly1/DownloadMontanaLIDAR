_Example data to download, images are examples around Bozeman, MT._

Function: A user to input a .shp file of their study area, the script automates the downloading, resampling, reprojecting, and mosaicing of all available data within the study area bounding box to generate a DEM, DSM, and CHM. <br>
**NOTE: I suggest avoiding bounding boxes larger than 50km by 50km or you may run out of RAM.**
